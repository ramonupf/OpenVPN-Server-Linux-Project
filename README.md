## Project Overview

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are usually used either to access local network resources from companies or institutions (in more professional settings) or to bypass regional restrictions, as well as in order to hide public IPs for various reasons. In this assignment I implement an OpenVPN server using a Linux machine. I demonstrate how clients can connect to this server and tunnel their traffic through it in order to access resources available from the serverâ€™s IP.

To describe the project, I first explain the installation of the server, including its requirements and technologies used. Then I describe the implementation together with a use-case. Afterwards, proof of testing to show that our configuration is successfully working is provided. In the last section there is some user documentation to answer the questions a user may have when using the server.
